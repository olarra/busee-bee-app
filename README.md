# React Native - Busee Bee App

This is the simple example React Native/Apollo app that lives at dev.apollodata.com.

## Installation

Clone the repository and run `npm install`:

```
git clone https://github.com/olarra/busee-bee-app
cd busee-bee-app
npm install
```

## Starting the app

Make sure you have [React Native installed](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html).

Once you've installed and started that server, start this app with:

```
react-native run-ios
```

It will open a iOS simulator.
